## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require orhanerday/open-ai
```
## Quick Start
Before you get starting, you should set OPENAI_API_KEY as ENV key, and set OpenAI key as env value with the following commands;

_Powershell_
```powershell
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-gjtv....."
```

_Cmd_
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-gjtv.....
```

_Linux or macOS_
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-gjtv.....
```
> Getting issues while setting up env? Please read the [article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).

Create your `index.php` file and paste the following code part into the file.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // remove this line if you use a PHP Framework.

use Orhanerday\OpenAi\OpenAi;

$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key);

$complete = $open_ai->completion([
    'model' => 'davinci',
    'prompt' => 'Hello',
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    'max_tokens' => 150,
    'frequency_penalty' => 0,
    'presence_penalty' => 0.6,
]);

var_dump($complete);
```

_Run the server with the following command_

```shell
php -S localhost:8000 -t .
```


## Usage

### Load your key from an environment variable.

> According to the following code `$open_ai` is the base variable for all open-ai operations.

```php
use Orhanerday\OpenAi\OpenAi;

$open_ai = new OpenAi(env('OPEN_AI_API_KEY'));
```

## Requesting organization

For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request.
Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's subscription quota.

````php
$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key, "org-IKN2E1nI3kFYU8ywaqgFRKqi");
````

## Custom URL

You can specify Origin URL with the third parameter of the OpenAI constructor method;

````php
$open_ai_key = getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY');
$organization = ""; // the empty string means there is no organization
$originURL = "https://ai.example.com/"; // the empty string mean the origin URL is 'https://api.openai.com'
$open_ai = new OpenAi($open_ai_key, $organization, $originURL);
````

## Custom URL

## Completions

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions, and can also return the probabilities of
alternative tokens at each position.

 ```php
$complete = $open_ai->completion([
    'model' => 'text-davinci-002',
    'prompt' => 'Hello',
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    'max_tokens' => 150,
    'frequency_penalty' => 0,
    'presence_penalty' => 0.6,
]);
```

### Stream Example

This feature might sound familiar from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.

 ````php
$open_ai = new OpenAi(env('OPEN_AI_API_KEY'));

$opts = [
    'prompt' => "Hello",
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    "max_tokens" => 150,
    "frequency_penalty" => 0,
    "presence_penalty" => 0.6,
    "stream" => true,
];

header('Content-type: text/event-stream');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');

$open_ai->completion($opts, function ($curl_info, $data) {
    echo $data . "<br><br>";
    echo PHP_EOL;
    ob_flush();
    flush();
    return strlen($data);
});

````

Add this part inside `<body>` of the HTML

 ````php
 
<div id="divID">Hello</div>
<script>
    var eventSource = new EventSource("/");
    var div = document.getElementById('divID');


    eventSource.onmessage = function (e) {
       if(e.data == "[DONE]")
       {
           div.innerHTML += "<br><br>Hello";
       }
        div.innerHTML += JSON.parse(e.data).choices[0].text;
    };
    eventSource.onerror = function (e) {
        console.log(e);
    };
</script>
````

You should see a response like the in video;

## Edits

Creates a new edit for the provided input, instruction, and parameters

 ```php
    $result = $open_ai->createEdit([
        "model" => "text-davinci-edit-001",
        "input" => "What day of the wek is it?",
        "instruction" => "Fix the spelling mistakes",
    ]);
```

## Images (DALLÂ·E)
> All DALLÂ·E Examples available in this [repo](https://github.com/orhanerday/DALLE-Examples).

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more generated images as urls or base64 encoded.

### Create image
Creates an image given a prompt.
 ```php
$complete = $open_ai->image([
    "prompt" => "A cat drinking milk",
    "n" => 1,
    "size" => "256x256",
    "response_format" => "url",
]);
```
### Create image edit
Creates an edited or extended image given an original image and a prompt.
> You need HTML upload for image edit or variation? Please check [DALLÂ·E Examples](https://github.com/orhanerday/DALLE-Examples)
````php
$otter = curl_file_create(__DIR__ . './files/otter.png');
$mask = curl_file_create(__DIR__ . './files/mask.jpg');

$result = $open_ai->imageEdit([
    "image" => $otter,
    "mask" => $mask,
    "prompt" => "A cute baby sea otter wearing a beret",
    "n" => 2,
    "size" => "1024x1024",
]);
````
### Create image variation
Creates a variation of a given image.
````php
$otter = curl_file_create(__DIR__ . './files/otter.png');

$result = $open_ai->createImageVariation([
    "image" => $otter,
    "n" => 2,
    "size" => "256x256",
]);
````

## Searches
**_(Deprecated)_**
> This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on December 3rd, 2022
> OpenAI developed new methods with better performance. [Learn more.](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272952-search-transition-guide)

Given a query and a set of documents or labels, the model ranks each document based on its semantic similarity to the
provided query.

```php
$search = $open_ai->search([
    'engine' => 'ada',
    'documents' => ['White House', 'hospital', 'school'],
    'query' => 'the president',
]);
```

## Embeddings

Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms.

Related guide: [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

### Create embeddings

```php
$result = $open_ai->embeddings([
    "model" => "text-similarity-babbage-001",
    "input" => "The food was delicious and the waiter..."
]);
```

## Answers

**_(Deprecated)_**

> This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on December 3rd, 2022
> Weâ€™ve developed new methods with better performance. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide).

Given a question, a set of documents, and some examples, the API generates an answer to the question based on the
information in the set of documents. This is useful for question-answering applications on sources of truth, like
company documentation or a knowledge base.

  ```php
$answer = $open_ai->answer([
    'documents' => ['Puppy A is happy.', 'Puppy B is sad.'],
    'question' => 'which puppy is happy?',
    'search_model' => 'ada',
    'model' => 'curie',
    'examples_context' => 'In 2017, U.S. life expectancy was 78.6 years.',
    'examples' => [['What is human life expectancy in the United States?', '78 years.']],
    'max_tokens' => 5,
    'stop' => ["\n", '<|endoftext|>'],
]);
```

## Classifications

**_(Deprecated)_**
> This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on December 3rd, 2022
> OpenAI developed new methods with better performance. [Learn more.](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272941-classifications-transition-guide)

Given a query and a set of labeled examples, the model will predict the most likely label for the query. Useful as a
drop-in replacement for any ML classification or text-to-label task.

 ```php
$classification = $open_ai->classification([
    'examples' => [
        ['A happy moment', 'Positive'],
        ['I am sad.', 'Negative'],
        ['I am feeling awesome', 'Positive'],
    ],
    'labels' => ['Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral'],
    'query' => 'It is a raining day =>(',
    'search_model' => 'ada',
    'model' => 'curie',
]);
```

## Content Moderations

Given a input text, outputs if the model classifies it as violating OpenAI's content policy.

```php
$flags = $open_ai->moderation([
    'input' => 'I want to kill them.'
]);
```
