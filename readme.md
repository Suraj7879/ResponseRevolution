How to make it realtime ?

Well, will make use of google ofcourse!!

So when i ask something instead of telling the answer directly, i will send it a prompt if i wanted to know "this" what would you search on google and when i get that response then i will perform the search from google and then return the results and then i will send another prompt that says if i wanted to know "this" what would you search on google and which of the result should i click and then when i get that answer i will fetch thats specific result from google and give it to chatGPT again and then ask the question, accoring to this information on this website what is the answer to this question!!

Maybe thats too many prompts and steps!!

so maybe i will just ask what should i google and then get the first result form the google or something like that!!
